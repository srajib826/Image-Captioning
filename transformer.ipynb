      "\"The image is a black and white photo. A young boy is sitting in the space between the poles of two parking meters off the ground. His arms are wrapped around the two meters and his feet are tucked behind the main bar supporting the two meters. He is smiling with his mouth wide open. He is dressed in warm weather clothing including dark shorts, a striped t-shirt, tennis shoes, and socks. His hair appears to be light colored. To the boy's left there is an older model car parked in a parking space. In the distance behind him there are several older model cars parked in a parking lot. The area is surrounded by mature trees. The concrete of the parking area in the foreground is stained from previous vehicles' fluid leakage. From the content of the photo and the models of vehicles, it appears this is a vintage photograph.\"\n",
